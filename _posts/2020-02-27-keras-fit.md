title: Keras fit & fit_generator tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn how the Keras .fit
  and .fit_generator
  functions work, including the differences between them. To help you gain hands-on experience, I’ve included a full example showing you how to implement a Keras data generator from scratch.
  The Keras .fit function

Let’s start with a call to .fit
 :
How to use Keras fit and fit_generator (a hands-on tutorial)
model.fit(trainX, trainY, batch_size=32, epochs=50)

Here you can see that we are supplying our training data (trainX
 ) and training labels (trainY
 ).

We then instruct Keras to allow our model to train for 50
  epochs with a batch size of 32
 .

The call to .fit
  is making two primary assumptions here:

    Our entire training set can fit into RAM
    There is no data augmentation going on (i.e., there is no need for Keras generators)

Instead, our network will be trained on the raw data.

The raw data itself will fit into memory — we have no need to move old batches of data out of RAM and move new batches of data into RAM.

Furthermore, we will not be manipulating the training data on the fly using data augmentation.
